/* DDL (Data Definitaion Language) : DDL commands are used to create or change the structure of the database and its tables (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)
--> CREATE , ALTER , DROP , TRUNCATE

DCL (Data Control Language) : DCL commands are used to control access to the database.
--> GRANT : Give permission
--> REVOKE : Remove permission

DML (Data Manipulation Language) : DML commands are used to work with the data inside the tables. They help you add, change, remove.
--> INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE
*/

-- 12) What is the role of the MySQL JOIN clause in a query, and what are some common types of joins?
/* 
The JOIN clause is used to combine data from two or more tables based onn a related column (Usally a foreign key)
--> It allows you to see connected information stored in different tables in one result.

--> Types of JOIN
1) Inner JOIN : Returns only the rows that match in both tables.
2) Left JOIN : Returns all rows from the left table and only matching rows from the right tables.
3) Right JOIN : Returns all rows from the right table and only matching rows from the left tables.
4) Full JOIN : Returns all rows from both tables whenther matches or not.
5) Cross JOIN : Returns the cartesian product (Every row from table A combined with every row from table B).
